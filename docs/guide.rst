This page highlights some of the features of ``crystals``. In case anything is unclear, 
`raising an issue <https://github.com/LaurentRDC/crystals/issues/>`_ would be appreciated.

The :class:`Crystal` class
==========================

Handling crystal models is the main feature of the :mod:`crystals` library. This is done through the :class:`Crystal` class, a representation of a crystal including 
unit cell atoms, lattice parameters, and other goodies.

Since working with :class:`Crystal` instances is so important, there are many ways to construct them.

Constructing a :class:`Crystal` object
--------------------------------------
Creating a :class:`Crystal` object can be done most easily from a Crystal Information File (CIF, .cif)::
    
    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> TiSe2 = Crystal.from_cif('tise2.cif')

:mod:`crystals` also has an internal database of CIF files. Valid names are stored in :attr:`Crystal.builtins` and can be
constructed like so::

    >>> Crystal.builtins
    frozenset({'Ac',
               'Ag',
               'Al',
               (...omitted...)
               'alpha-Mn',
               'b-Pu',
               'diamond',
               'gamma-Pu'
               })
    >>> 'Au' in Crystal.builtins
    True
    >>> Crystal.from_database('Au')
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom Au @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.00)
        Atom Au @ (0.00, 0.50, 0.50)
        Atom Au @ (0.50, 0.00, 0.50)
        Atom Au @ (0.50, 0.50, 0.00)
    Lattice parameters:
        a=4.078Å, b=4.078Å, c=4.078Å
        α=90.000°, β=90.000°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
        Au: 100.000%
    Source:
        (...omitted...)crystals\cifs\Au.cif >

`RCSB Protein DataBank <http://www.rcsb.org/>`_ files are even easier to handle; simply provide the 4-letter identification code
and the structure file will be taken care of by :mod:`crystals`::
    
    >>> hemoglobin = Crystal.from_pdb('1gzx')
    >>> print(hemoglobin)
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom C  @ (0.85, 0.79, 0.96)
        Atom C  @ (0.86, 0.85, 0.94)
        Atom C  @ (0.92, 0.99, 0.63)
        Atom C  @ (0.38, 0.68, 0.09)
        Atom C  @ (0.14, 0.62, 0.88)
        Atom C  @ (0.53, 0.84, 0.07)
        Atom C  @ (0.11, 0.77, 0.40)
        Atom C  @ (0.70, 0.23, 0.66)
        Atom C  @ (0.60, 0.10, 0.83)
        Atom C  @ (0.92, 0.10, 0.49)
        ... omitting 19066 atoms ...
    Lattice parameters:
        a=97.050Å, b=99.500Å, c=66.110Å
        α=90.000°, β=90.000°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
        C: 61.942%
        O: 21.367%
        N: 16.356%
        S: 0.252%
        Fe: 0.084%
    Source:
        (...omitted...)\crystals_cache\pdb1gzx.ent >

Another convenient way to construct a :class:`Crystal` is through the `Crystallography Open Database <http://www.crystallography.net/cod/>`_::

    >>> # Default is the latest revision
    >>> vo2 = Crystal.from_cod(1521124)
    >>> # Revisions are accessible as well
    >>> old_vo2 = Crystal.from_cod(1521124, revision = 140771)

Constructing a :class:`Crystal` object by hand
----------------------------------------------
If you don't have a file on hand, or want to create an idealized crystal, consider building a :class:`Crystal`
object by hand.

To do this, you need:

1. iterable of :class:`Atom` objects, with coordinates. These atoms must be the full unit cell;
2. three lattice vectors;

As an example, let's create the simplest crystal structure known: 
`alpha-Polonium (simple cubic) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium#Solid_state_form>`_::
    
    >>> from crystals import Crystal, Atom
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>>
    >>> lattice_vectors = 3.35 * np.eye(3)
    >>> unitcell = [Atom('Po', coords = [0,0,0])]
    >>>
    >>> polonium = Crystal(unitcell, lattice_vectors)

In the case where atoms are given as an asymmetric unit cell and a set of symmetry operators, you can use the
:func:`symmetry_expansion` function to generate a set of *unique* atoms (even if some symmetry operators might be redundant).
The generated set of atoms can be passed to the constructor of :class:`Crystal`.

Crystal attributes
------------------
The :class:`Crystal` object provides some interfaces for easy structure manipulation. First, a :class:`Crystal` is an iterable::

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> 
    >>> for atm in graphite:
    ...	    print(atm)
    ...		
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.33, 0.67, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >
    
The :func:`len` of a :class:`Crystal` is the unit cell size (in number of atoms)::

    >>> hemoglobin = Crystal.from_pdb('1gzx')
    >>> len(hemoglobin)
    17536

The :class:`Crystal` class is a set-like container; checking containership (with the builtin ``in`` statement) is very fast::

    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> carbon = next(iter(graphite))			# Pick any atom from the crystal
    >>> 
    >>> carbon in graphite 
    True

:class:`Crystal` instances can be equated to each other::

    >>> gold = Crystal.from_database('Au')
    >>> silver = Crystal.from_database('Ag')
    >>>
    >>> gold == silver
    False

If a :class:`Crystal` was generated from a file, the path to its file can be retrieved
from the :attr:`source` attribute::

    >>> hemoglobin = Crystal.from_pdb('1gzx')
    >>> print(hemoglobin.source)
    '(...omitted...)\pdb1gzx.ent'

:class:`Crystal` instances have a nice string representation (with :func:`str`), and a complete string representation (with :func:`repr`):

    >>> vo2 = Crystal.from_database('vo2-m1')
    >>> print(vo2)	   # Short string representation
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom O  @ (0.90, 0.79, 0.80)
        Atom O  @ (0.90, 0.71, 0.30)
        Atom O  @ (0.61, 0.31, 0.71)
        Atom O  @ (0.39, 0.69, 0.29)
        Atom O  @ (0.61, 0.19, 0.21)
        Atom O  @ (0.10, 0.29, 0.70)
        Atom O  @ (0.10, 0.21, 0.20)
        Atom O  @ (0.39, 0.81, 0.79)
        Atom V  @ (0.76, 0.03, 0.97)
        Atom V  @ (0.76, 0.48, 0.47)
        ... omitting 2 atoms ...
    Lattice parameters:
        a=5.743Å, b=4.517Å, c=5.375Å
        α=90.000°, β=122.600°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
        O: 66.667%
        V: 33.333%
    Source:
        (...omitted...)\crystals\cifs\vo2-m1.cif >
    

:class:`Crystal` instances can be converted to NumPy arrays as well::

    >>> import numpy
    >>> numpy.array(Crystal.from_database('Si'))
    array([[14.  ,  0.  ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ],
           [14.  ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.  ],
           [14.  ,  0.  ,  0.  ,  0.  ],
           [14.  ,  0.75,  0.75,  0.25],
           [14.  ,  0.5 ,  0.  ,  0.5 ],
           [14.  ,  0.75,  0.25,  0.75],
           [14.  ,  0.25,  0.75,  0.75],
           [14.  ,  0.25,  0.25,  0.25]])

:data:`arr` will contain one row per unit cell atom:

.. table::
    :widths: grid

    +--------------+-----------------------+
    |Atomic Number |Fractional coordinates |
    +==============+=======+========+======+
    |      Z1      |  x1   |   y1   |  z1  |
    +--------------+-------+--------+------+
    |      Z2      |  x2   |   y2   |  z2  |
    +--------------+-------+--------+------+
    |      Z3      |  x3   |   y3   |  z3  |
    +--------------+-------+--------+------+
    |            ...                       |
    +--------------------------------------+

Lattice vectors and reciprocal space
====================================
Once a :class:`Crystal` object is ready, you can manipulate the lattice parameters via the :class:`Lattice`
super-class. Let's use the built-in example of graphite::

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> 
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> 	
    >>> a1, a2, a3 = graphite.lattice_vectors
    >>> a1
    array([2.464, 0.   , 0.   ])
    >>> b1, b2, b3 = graphite.reciprocal_vectors
    >>> b1
    array([ 2.54999404,  1.47223974, 0.    ])
    >>>
    >>> np.dot(a1, b1)	# 2 pi
    6.283185307179586

The standard `three lengths and angles` description of a lattice is also accessible::

    >>> a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma = graphite.lattice_parameters

The unit cell volume (and by extensions, density) is also accessible::

    >>> vol = graphite.volume	# Angstroms cubed
    >>> density = vol/len(graphite)

As a lattice can be fully described by its basis vectors, a NumPy array can be created from a :class:`Lattice` instance.

Space-group Information
=======================
The `lattice system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice#Bravais_lattices_in_3_dimensions>`_ of a Lattice or Crystal instance is also available via the :attr:`lattice_system` attribute::

    >>> vo2 = Crystal.from_database('vo2-m1') # Monoclinic M1 VO2
    >>> vo2.lattice_system
    <LatticeSystem.monoclinic: 2>

Better control on length tolerances is available via the :func:`lattice_system` function.

Thanks to `spglib <http://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_, we can get space-group information from a :class:`Crystal` instance::

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>>
    >>> gold = Crystal.from_database('Au')
    >>> gold.symmetry()
    {'international_symbol': 'Fm-3m', 
     'hall_symbol': '-F 4 2 3',
     'hm_symbol': 'Fm-3m', 
     'international_number': 225, 
     'hall_number': 523, 
     'international_full': 'F 4/m -3 2/m', 
     'pointgroup': 'Oh'}

In the above example, :data:`spg_info` is a dictionary with the following keys:

* ``'international_symbol'``: International Tables of Crystallography space-group symbol (short);

* ``'international_full'``: International Tables of Crystallography space-group full symbol;

* ``'hall_symbol'`` : Hall symbol;

* ``'hm_symbol'`` : Hermann-Mauguin symbol;

* ``'pointgroup'`` : International Tables of Crystallography point-group;

* ``'international_number'`` : International Tables of Crystallography space-group number (between 1 and 230);

* ``'hall_number'`` : Hall number (between 1 and 531).

Each of those items are also available directly from the :class:`Crystal` instance. The Hall number of a crystal structure 
is located in the ``crystal.hall_number`` attribute, the short international symbol is located in the ``crystal.international_symbol`` 
attribute, and so on.

Scattering utilities
====================
:class:`Lattice` objects have a few methods that make life easier when dealing with scattering data and modeling.

The conversion between Miller indices and scattering vectors is available:: 

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>>
    >>> # Behavior inherited from Lattice superclass
    >>> G = graphite.scattering_vector(1,0,0)
    >>> graphite.miller_indices(*G)
    (array([1.]), array([0.]), array([0.]))

Supercells
==========
For various reasons, creating a supercell from a crystal might be desirable. The process is very easy. 
Let's imagine we want to create a 2x2x2 supercell of graphite::

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>>
    >>> for atm in graphite: # Iterate over the unitcell
    ...     print(atm)
    ...
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.33, 0.67, 0.25) >
    >>>
    >>> for atm in graphite.supercell(2,2,2):   # Iterate over the supercell
    ...    print(atm)
    ...
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 1.33, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 1.33, 1.75) >
    (... omitting 24 atoms ...)
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 0.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 0.00, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 1.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 1.00, 1.75) >

Supercells are generated by copying unit cells along crystallographic axes. For example, a 2x3x5 supercell will be extended by 2x along 
the ``a1`` lattice vector, extended by 3x along the ``a2`` lattice vector, and extended by 5x along the ``a3`` lattice vector.

A :class:`Supercell` can also be generated using the same constructors as the :class:`Crystal` class. These constructors include:

* ``Supercell.from_cif``: create an instance from a CIF file;

* ``Supercell.from_pdb``: create an instance from a Protein Data Bank entry;

* ``Supercell.from_database``: create an instance from the internal database of CIF files;

* ``Supercell.from_cod``: create an instance from a Crystallography Open Database entry.

* ``Supercell.from_ase``: create an instance from an ``ase.Atoms`` instance.

A :class:`Supercell` is different than a :class:`Crystal` in only a few ways. Iterating over a :class:`Supercell` yields more atoms, 
but otherwise you can still determine symmetry, retrieve lattice vectors, get chemical composition, etc.

Compatibility with ASE
======================
The `Atomic Simulation Environment <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html>`_ is a powerful tool. You can harness its power and convert
between :class:`ase.Atoms` and :class:`crystals.Crystal` at will.

To create an :class:`ase.Atoms` object from a :class:`Crystal`, use the :meth:`Crystal.ase_atoms` method::

    >>> from ase.calculators.abinit import Abinit
    >>> from crystals import Crystal, ase_atoms
    >>>
    >>> gold = Crystal.from_database('Au')
    >>> ase_gold = ase_atoms(gold, calculator = Abinit(...))

All keywords of the :class:`ase.Atoms` constructor are supported. To get back to a :class:`Crystal` instance::

    >>> gold2 = Crystal.from_ase(ase_gold)

The :class:`Atom` Class
=======================
The basis of structure manipulations is to manipulate atoms. :class:`Atom` objects are in the
category of `Transformable` objects, meaning that their coordinates can be transformed
according to any affine transform.

To create an atom, simply provide its element and coordinates::
    
    >>> from crystals import Atom
    >>> 
    >>> copper = Atom(element = 'Cu', coords = [0,0,0])

Optional information can be given, such as magnetic moment and mean-squared displacement. For users of :mod:`ase`, 
another possibility is to instantiate an :class:`Atom` from an :class:`ase.Atom` using the :meth:`Atom.from_ase` 
constructor.

:class:`Atom` instances are hashable; they can be used as ``dict`` keys or stored in a ``set``.

Since we are most concerned with atoms in crystals, the coordinates here are assumed to be fractional.
If the atom was created as part of a structure, the real-space position with respect to its parent (:class:`Crystal` 
or :class:`Lattice`) can be accessed using the :meth:`Atom.coords_cartesian` method::

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> 
    >>> carbon = list(graphite)[-1]
    >>> carbon.coords_fractional
    array([0.  , 0.  , 0.75])
    >>> carbon.coords_cartesian
    array([0.  , 0.  , 5.033])

Atomic distances
----------------

The fractional/cartesian distance between two atoms sitting *on the same lattice* is possible::

    >>> from crystals import Crystal, distance_fractional, distance_cartesian
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> 
    >>> carbon1, carbon2, *_ = tuple(graphite)
    >>> carbon1
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.25) >
    >>> carbon2
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >
    >>> distance_fractional(carbon1, carbon2)
    0.8975324197487241
    >>> distance_cartesian(carbon1, carbon2)    # in Angstroms
    3.6446077732986644

If atoms are not sitting on the same lattice, calculating the distance should not be defined. In this case, an exception is raised::

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> gold = Crystal.from_database('Au')
    >>> silver = Crystal.from_database('Ag')
    >>>
    >>> gold1, *_ = tuple(gold)
    >>> silver1, *_ = tuple(silver)
    >>>
    >>> distance_cartesian(gold1, silver1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "(...omitted...)\crystals\atom.py", line 181, in distance_cartesian
        "Cartesian distance is undefined if atoms are sitting on different lattices."
    RuntimeError: Distance is undefined if atoms are sitting on different lattices.

Elements
--------

If all you want is access to elemental information, like atomic weights, you can instantiate an :class:`Element` instead of an :class:`Atom`::

    >>> from crystals import Element
    >>> Element("H")
    < Hydrogen >
    >>> Element("Cu").mass # Atomic mass in [u]
    63.546
    >>> Element("Cu).atomic_number
    29
    >>>
    >>> Element(29)   # You can also specify elements by their number
    < Element object : Copper >

Since :class:`Atom` is a subclass of :class:`Element`, all of the above examples also work for :class:`Atom`:

    >>> from crystals import Atom
    >>>
    >>> Atom("Cu", coords = [0,0,0]).mass
    63.546
