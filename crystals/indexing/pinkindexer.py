    Index reflections using pinkindexer, and indexing routine that can be
    used in a variety of contexts including measurements made with a
    monochromatic radiation source, a polychromatic source or with radiation
    of very short wavelength.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3.1

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : ndarray, shape (N, 2)
        Each row represents a peak location [x, y] on the detector [m]
    intensities : ndarray, shape (N,)
        Scattering intensity for each row in `peaks` [a.u.]
    detector_distance : float
        Distance between the sample and detector [m]
    beam_energy : float
        Radiation energy [eV]
    divergence_angle : float
        Divergence angle [deg]
    non_monochromaticity: float
        I don't know what that is yet.
    detector_radius : float
        Detector radius [m]
    initial : Lattice or Crystal
        Initial guess for the crystal structure. If a :class:`Lattice`
        instance is provided, it is assumed that it is the **primitive**
        lattice. If a :class:`Crystal` instances is provided,
        the primitive lattice will be calculated.

    Returns
    -------
    indexed_lattice : :class:`Lattice`
        Lattice that indexes `peaks` best.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the number of peaks does not match the intensities provided.
        If the dimensions of the reciprocal lattice are not adequate.
