`crystals` is a library of data structure and algorithms to manipulate abstract crystals. `crystals` helps with reading crystallographic 
files (like .cif and .pdb), provides access to atomic positions, and allows for space-group determination. Take a look at the `documentation <https://crystals.readthedocs.io/>`_
for more information.

Installation
============

`crystals` can be installed from source::

    git clone https://github.com/LaurentRDC/crystals.git
    cd crystals
    python setup.py install

You can install the latest development version using `pip` as well::

    python -m pip install git+git://github.com/LaurentRDC/crystals.git

`crystals` is also available on the Python Package Index::

    pip install crystals
